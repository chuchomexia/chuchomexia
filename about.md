Hi. I'm Jesus Mejia and Iâ€™m an industrial design student at Universidad Industrial de Santander in Santander, Colombia. My main skill is related to the creation of a small and medium business, starting from the graphic context to the marketing plan and effective sale of the product/service.

I highlight the cleanliness, precision and order that characterize me as a designer, in addition to the rapid resolution of problems as leader of the tasks assigned to me.
